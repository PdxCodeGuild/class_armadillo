## While Loops

While loops will execute their body while the given condition is true

```javascript
let i = 0
while (i < 10) {
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
```


## For Loops

For loops have three parts, separated by semi-colons. The first is the **initialization**, the second is the **condition** and the third is the **increment**. These are simply the parts of the `while` loop from above re-arranged.

```javascript
for (let i=0; i<10; ++i) {
    console.log(i)
}
```
