## Lab 4: Simple Clock

Make a clock that displays the current time and updates every second. Check out [JavaScript timing events](../docs/Timing.md) and [dates](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp). Writing `new Date()` creates a date with the current date and time. You can then create a string by calling methods on that date, and set it in the DOM. If you have time, check out the [full clock lab](optional-clock.md).

## Lab 5: Random Redirector

Create a page which randomly redirectly to another. Start with an array of urls (as strings), and randomly pick one using `Math.random()`. Then redirect to the page by assigning the url to [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location). Using JavaScript's timing events, show a 5-second countdown to the user. When the countdown is finished, redirect to a random page.
