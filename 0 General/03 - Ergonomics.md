# Ergonomics

If you become a professional programmer, it's not uncommon to be sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus any time you're on your computer at home. It's therefore important that you maintain good posture to avoid injury and maintain general health.

- Sit upright, with your spine vertical and thighs horizontal
- Your elbow should be at a 90 degree angle, with your forearms parallel to the floor
- Your hands should hover just over your keyboard
- You should only apply as much force in each keystroke as necessary to trigger the key
- Take at least 5 minutes every hour to stand up and walk around

You can find more information about ergonomics from [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169) and [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations). You can find tons of ergonomic furniture, keyboards, mice, etc at [The Human Solution](https://www.thehumansolution.com/).


## Keyboards

Keyboards have praticular ergonomic importance because our fingers move most, and our wrists are susceptible to inflamation.

Most keyboards are 'rubber-dome' keyboards, which consist of an actuator held up by a small dome of rubber. When the actuator is pressed, it makes contact with the circuit-board, and registers a key-press. Mechanical keyboards have keys which actuate before they bottom-out, so you don't have to press key down all the way. This results in softer typing and less stress on your finger joints. Mechanical keyboards are often more expensive, but they've also become more popular recently, now a decent mechanical keyboard can be had for around $40.

Below are a few high-end keyboards which are specifically designed to be ergonomic.
