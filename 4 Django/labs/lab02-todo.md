# Lab 2: Todo

## Version 1

Let's create a simple todo app. This can be done with a single model `TodoItem` which contains a text **description**, a **created date**, a **completed date**, and a boolean representing whether it was **completed**. The user should be presented with an input field and a button (in a form). When the clicks the button, it should save the data to the server and show the newly-added item in the list.


## Version 2

Let's add a separate form for deleting a todo item. It should contain a drop-down list of items, and a submit button.
