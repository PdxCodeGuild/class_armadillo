Lab 20 Quote API (4/29/20)

For this lab we'll be using the [Favqs Quotes API](https://favqs.com/api) to first get a random quote, and then allow the user to find quotes by keyword. To accomplish this we'll be using the `requests` and `json` libraries. The example below uses a Chuck Norris joke API.

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'
response = requests.get(url) # send the request to the api
print(response.text) # look at the raw json
data = json.loads(response.text) # turn the json into a python dictionary
print(data['value']) # get a part of the response data out of the dictionary
```


Version 1: Get a Random Quote

The URL to get a random quote is [https://favqs.com/api/qotd](https://favqs.com/api/qotd), 
send a request here, parse the JSON in the response into a python dictionary, and show the quote and the author.



Version 2: List Quotes by Keyword

The Favqs Quote API also supports getting a list of quotes associated with a given 
keyword `https://favqs.com/api/quotes?page=<page>&filter=<keyword>`. 
Prompt the user for a keyword, list the quotes you get in response, and prompt 
the user to either show the next page or enter a new keyword. You can use string concatenation to build the URL.

```
> enter a keyword to search for quotes: nature
25 quotes associated with nature - page 1
<list of quotes>
> enter 'next page' or 'done': next page
25 quotes associated with nature - page 2
<list of quotes>
> enter 'next page' or 'done': done
> enter a keyword to search for quotes:
```

This API endpoint requires an API key be included in a request header. You can find documentation of specifying request headers [here](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers) and documentation on authorization with the Favqs API [here](https://favqs.com/api/) under "Authorization".

```python
url = 'https://favqs.com/api/quotes?page=1&filter=nature'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Token token="855df50978dc9afd6bf86579913c9f8b"'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```
