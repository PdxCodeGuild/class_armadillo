'''Compute the ARI for a given body of text loaded in from a 
file. The automated readability index (ARI) is a formula for 
computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. The 
general formula to compute the ARI is as follows:

ARI Formula

The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters 
divided by the number of words by 4.71, adding the number of 
words divided by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and 
subtracting 21.43. If the result is a decimal, always round up. 
Scores greater than 14 should be presented as having the same age 
and grade level as scores of 14.

Scores correspond to the following ages and grade levels:

    Score  Ages     Grade Level
     1       5-6    Kindergarten
     2       6-7    First Grade
     3       7-8    Second Grade
     4       8-9    Third Grade
     5      9-10    Fourth Grade
     6     10-11    Fifth Grade
     7     11-12    Sixth Grade
     8     12-13    Seventh Grade
     9     13-14    Eighth Grade
    10     14-15    Ninth Grade
    11     15-16    Tenth Grade
    12     16-17    Eleventh grade
    13     17-18    Twelfth grade
    14     18-22    College
Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the following 
dictionary to look up the age range and grade level.'''
