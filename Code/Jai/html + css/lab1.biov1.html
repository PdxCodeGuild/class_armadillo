    <p>Muhammad Ali was Born, Cassius Clay on Januarary 17th, 1942 and traveled to another deminsion via death in june of 2016. He is most notably known for being one of the most celebrated sports figures onf the 20th century. He is one of the top Heavyweight champions in the sport of boxing to ever live, with a total of 56 wins and just 5 losses. He is considered a civil rights leader for standing up for Black people in the 20th century and for speaking out against and evading the vietnam war with the famous words "no vietnamese ever called me N****". The reason he was so fearless when speaking to the white man was because he was a follower of The Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad who was the messenger of Allah, sent to awaken the minds of the Asiatic Black man in the wilderness of North America. Elijah Muhammad taugt Muhammad ali everything he knew of faith and politics. Muhammad is the most overlooked figure of the 20th century, Even though he was the force behind such prolific men as Ali and Malcolm X. it makes one wonder why.</p>
