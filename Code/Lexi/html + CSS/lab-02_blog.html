                Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Pico de gallo (Nick Gallo?), on the side please. Does guac cost extra? It’s taco time all the time. TACOS!! Make it a double there pal. Make it a double there pal. If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? I’d have to say, those tacos are on fleek. Black or pinto beans? TACOS!! It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. Carne asada on corn tortillas.

<!-- # Lab 2: Blog

Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav and multiple posts. Use the [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) header, nav, section, and footer. You can use a [custom font](https://fonts.google.com/), [fancy colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), and make generate fake content using [Lorem Ipsum](https://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/). You may also want to use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and apply [responsive design](../docs/09%20-%20CSS%20Responsive%20Design.md). -->
