            Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Pico de gallo, on the side please. Does guac cost extra? It’s taco time all the time. TACOS!! Make it a double there pal. Make it a double there pal. If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? I’d have to say, those tacos are on fleek. Black or pinto beans? TACOS!! It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. Carne asada on corn tortillas.
