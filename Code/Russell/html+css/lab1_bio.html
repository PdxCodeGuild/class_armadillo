      Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is
      regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.
      He received multiple nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and nominations
      for Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902 and 1910 and the fact that he never won is a major Nobel prize controversy.
      Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had
      a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
      Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he
      incorporated into his writing, particularly Resurrection (1899). He was born 9 September 1828 in
      Tula Province, Russia and died November 9, 1910 Astapovo. Tolstoy's work include:
