##Name
Giro de Giro

##Project Overview
The project will be a place for Portland area bike riders to gather digitally to host and find social bike rides.

##Functionality
The functionality will have two main parts, "host a ride" and "find a ride". 
If you click host a ride, this is where the main model will present itself, you'll have the ability to input a ride for others to find, or make it private with a special url to direct your friends to your private ride. For more information on the model please see below. 

##Data Model
The way I figure the model needs to be setup is:

#host_a_ride(model.Models):
    Ride name:
    Author: 
    Start time:
    End time:
    Start location:
    Way points: will allow the user to post way points with estamated 
    End location:

##Schedule

week 1:

week 2:

week 3:

time up until presentation:

after presentation:
    build react native app to handle real time tracking.

Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
