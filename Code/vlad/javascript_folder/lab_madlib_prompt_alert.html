<!-- Lab 1-3: Pick 3
Pick 3 Python labs and re-do them in JavaScript. You should first try to write them using JavaScript's prompt and alert in place of Python's input and print. Once you have that working, use input and button elements, with events. You can read the docs on DOM Manipulation and Events. You can view a demo here.
