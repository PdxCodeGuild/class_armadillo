        <h1> Introduction - Early life</h1>
        <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan <a href="https://www.nba.com/history/legends/profiles/michael-jordan "> MJ the Legend
            </a> (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[6] is an American former
            professional basketball player and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball
            Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. His
            biography on the official NBA website states: <q>By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball
                player of all time.</q> [7] He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and
            was
            considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

        <p>He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. His biography on the
            official NBA website states: <q>By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all
                time. [7] He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered
                instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was
                a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the
                third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific
                scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mny1kAxF2zQ" title="Slam Dunk Contest">Slam Dunk Contests</a>, earned him the
                nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness". He also gained a reputation as
                one of the best defensive players in basketball.[9] He won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in
                1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "three-peat". Although
                Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season and started a new career in Minor
                League Baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships
                in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He
                retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a
                member of the Washington Wizard</p>

            <p>Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals
                Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five MVP Awards, ten
                All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game
                selections, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, three steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of
                the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points
                per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the
                greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the
                Associated Press' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the Naismith
                Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career and again in
                2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream
                Team"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 </p>

            <p>Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers
                which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.[10] Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996
                film Space Jam. He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now
                Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014 Jordan became the first billionaire
                player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1 billion, he is the fourth-richest African-American,
                behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, and Oprah Winfrey.</p>

            <p>ordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn,[11] to Deloris (née Peoples), who worked
                in banking, and James R. Jordan Sr., an equipment supervisor. His family moved to Wilmington, North
                Carolina, when he was a toddler.[12]

                Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by
                playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his
                sophomore year, but at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend,
                Harvest Leroy Smith, was the only sophomore to make the team.[13][14]

                Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team, and tallied several
                40-point games.[13] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[7][14]
                Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his
                final two seasons of high school play.[15] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's
                All-American Game and scored 30 points,[16][17] after averaging 27 points,[15] 12 rebounds[18][19] and 6
                assists per game for the season.[19][20][21]

                Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South
                Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[22] In 1981, Jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[23]</p>

            <h1>College career</h1>
            <p>As a freshman <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-04-30/michael-jordan-college-stats-best-games-quotes-moments"> title="University Athletic Experience"</a>in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he
                averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[24] He made the game-winning jump shot in
                the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[7]
                Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[25] During his
                three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rpg.[1] He was
                selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984)
                seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan
                left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago
                Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie
                (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the
                first two teams were in need of a center.[26] However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended
                that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in
                part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[27]
                ESPN, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft
                pick in North American professional sports history.[28] Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete
                his degree in 1986.[29] He graduated the same year with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[30]</p>

            <h1>Professional career</h1>
            <h3>Early NBA years (1984–1987)</h3>
            <p>Jordan's second season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to
                miss 64 games.[7] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record, at the time
                the fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[37][38] Jordan recovered
                in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston
                Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,[39] Jordan set the
                still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2.[40] The Celtics, however, managed
                to sweep the series.[36]</p>
            <p>Jordan had completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[41] and he had one of the most prolific
                scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000
                points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.[24][42] In addition, Jordan
                demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals
                and 100 blocked shots in a season.[43] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the league's Most
                Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins,[37] and advanced to the playoffs for the third
                consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.[36]</p>

            <h4>Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)</h4>
            <p>Jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5%
                shooting[24] and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the Defensive Player of the Year, as
                he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game.[44] The Bulls finished 50–32,[37] and
                made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated
                the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[45] However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more
                experienced Detroit Pistons,[36] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as
                the "Bad Boys".[46]</p>

            <p>In the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from
                the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[24] The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[37] and advanced to
                the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. The Cavaliers
                series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit The Shot over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the
                fifth and final game of the series.[47] However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six
                games,[36] by utilizing their "Jordan Rules" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and
                triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[7]

                The Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young
                improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil
                Jackson.[48] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the
                Cavaliers.[49] He averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3
                apg[24] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[37] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals
                after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the
                Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[36]</p>

            <h1>National team career</h1>
            <p>Jordan played on two Olympic gold medal-winning American basketball teams. He won a gold medal as a
                college player in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such
                as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in
                scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[139]

                In the 1992 Summer Olympics, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included Magic Johnson and
                Larry Bird that was dubbed the "Dream Team". Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the
                Olympics. Playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, Jordan averaged 14.9 ppg,[140] finishing
                second on the team in scoring.[141] Jordan and fellow Dream Team members Ewing and Mullin are the only
                American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.[139][140]
            </p>

            <h1>First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1994)</h1>
            <p> On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss of desire to play the game. Jordan
                later stated that the death of his father three months earlier also shaped his decision.[69] Jordan's
                father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two
                teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his luxury Lexus bearing the license
                plate "UNC 0023".[70][71] His body was dumped in a South Carolina swamp and was not discovered until
                August 3.[71] The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone.[72] The
                two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his
                father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in
                work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket.[7] In
                1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[73][74]</p>
            <p>In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he had been preparing for
                retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[75] The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the
                1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status.
                Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers
                around the world.[76] </p>
            <p>Jordan then further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the
                Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[77] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was
                assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[78] Jordan has stated this decision was
                made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League
                Baseball player.[79] The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued
                to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[80] </p>

            <p>In 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White
                Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 base on
                balls, and 11 errors.[81] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League,
                batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[78] On November 1, 1994, his number 23 was retired
                by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit
                outside the new United Center.[82][83][84] </p>

            <h1> <q>I'm back</q>: Return to the NBA (1995)</h1>
            <p>In the 1993–94 season, the Bulls achieved a 55–27 record without Jordan in the lineup,[37] and lost to
                the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the
                championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs,
                Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March.[85] The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to
                return to the Bulls.[86] </p>
            <p>In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball due to the ongoing Major League Baseball strike, as he
                wanted to avoid becoming a potential replacement player.[87] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his
                return to the NBA through a two-word press release: "I'm back."[7] The next day, Jordan took to the
                court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[88] The game had the
                highest Nielsen rating of a regular season NBA game since 1975.[89] Although he could have opted to wear
                his normal number in spite of the Bulls having retired it, Jordan instead wore number 45, as he had
                while playing baseball.[88] </p>
            <p>Although he had not played an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a
                game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He then scored 55 points in the next
                game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[36] Boosted by Jordan's comeback,
                the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the
                Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the
                game-winning basket for the Magic; he would later comment that Jordan "didn't look like the old Michael
                Jordan"[90] and that "No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to."[91] </p>

            <p>Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan
                decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former number, 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for
                failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[91] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for
                opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[92] He averaged 31 points per game
                in the series, but Orlando won the series in six games.[1] </p>

            <h1>Post-retiremen</h1>
            <p>After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position
                as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.[142] However, his previous tenure in the Wizards'
                front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of
                Richard "Rip" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball
                Operations in 2002).[117] On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as the team's president
                of basketball operations.[117] Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he
                would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.[68] </p>
            <p>Jordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity
                tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line
                and rode motorcycles.[143] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional
                closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike
                championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013
                season.[144][145] </p>


            <h3>Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets</h3>

            <p>On June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the team's
                second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took
                full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title "Managing Member of Basketball
                Operations".[146] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be
                included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[147] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become
                part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner
                George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[148] </p>

            <p>In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats,[149] who
                changed their nickname to the Hornets in 2014.[150] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan
                and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the
                team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his
                group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team pending NBA approval.[151] On March 17, the NBA Board of
                Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the
                majority owner of an NBA team.[152] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner
                of an NBA team.[153] </p>
            <p>During the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners
                who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47.
                Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards
                then-owner Abe Pollin, "If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team."[154] Jason Whitlock of
                FoxSports.com called Jordan a "sellout" wanting "current players to pay for his incompetence."[155] He
                cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[155]
            </p>
            <p> During the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59
                record. Their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[156] "I'm not real happy about the
                record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating," Jordan said later that year.[157] During
                the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim,
                retaining the majority of the team for himself.[158]</p>

            <h1>Personal life</h1>
            <p> Jordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a
                daughter, Jasmine. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable
                differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final
                decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made "mutually
                and amicably".[207][208] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to
                $213 million in 2019), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the
                time.[209][210]</p>
            <p>In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, to build a 56,000 square-foot (5,200 m2)
                mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in
                2012.[211] His two sons attended Loyola Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school located in
                Wilmette, Illinois.[212] Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first
                collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the University of Illinois. After two seasons,
                Jeffrey left the Illinois basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third
                season,[213][214] then received a release to transfer to the University of Central Florida, where Marcus
                was attending.[215][216] Marcus transferred to Whitney Young High School after his sophomore year at
                Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009,[217] and played three
                seasons of basketball for the school.[218] </p>
            <p>Jordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and James R. Jordan Jr.,
                one older sister, Deloris, and one younger sister, Roslyn.[219][220] James retired in 2006 as the
                Command Sergeant Major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the XVIII Airborne Corps in the U.S. Army.[221]
                Jordan's nephew through Larry, Justin Jordan, played Division I basketball at UNC Greensboro and is a
                scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[222][223] </p>

            <p>On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former
                lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[224] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel
                $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[225][226][227] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5
                million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was
                pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[224] </p>
            <p>He proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[228] and
                they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[229][230] It was announced
                on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[231][232] On February 11,
                2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[233] Jordan became a
                grandfather in 2019 when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional
                basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[234]</p>

            <h1>Charity</h1>
            <p>From 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational,
                that raised money for various charities.[235] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to
                Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[236] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity
                and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[237] </p>
            <p>The Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[235] Five years later, he
                granted his 200th wish for the organization.[238] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the
                Make-A-Wish Foundation.[235] </p>
            <p>In 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had
                used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[239] Jordan funded two Novant Health
                Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2017 by giving $7 million, the biggest
                donation he had made at the time.[240] One year later, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North
                Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[241]
                He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[242] </p>
