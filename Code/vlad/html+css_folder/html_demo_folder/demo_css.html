Hex counts to 16 using letters to represent number 10-16. So it's characters are 1-9 and A-F. Pairs of characters are multiplied together to get a value between 1 and 256 which is 0 - 255 when you start at index 0.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  A   B   C   D   E   F


A1 = 161.
Since A is in the first place, it's multiplied by 16^1. So 10 x 16 is 160
Since 1 is in the second place, it's multiplied by 16^0 which is just 1.
Therefore 10 * 16^0 + 1 * 16^0 = 161

...F8 = 248, F9 = 249, FA = 250, FB = 251, FC = 252, FD = 253, FE = 254, FF = 255
