#Lab 19: Compute Automated Readability Index:

"""
Compute the ARI for a given body of text loaded in from a file. The automated readability index (ARI) is a formula for computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. The general formula to compute the ARI is as follows:

ARI Formula

The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters divided by the number of words by 4.71, adding the number of words divided by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43. If the result is a decimal, always round up. Scores greater than 14 should be presented as having the same age and grade level as scores of 14.

Scores correspond to the following ages and grad levels:

    Score  Ages     Grade Level
     1       5-6    Kindergarten
     2       6-7    First Grade
     3       7-8    Second Grade
     4       8-9    Third Grade
     5      9-10    Fourth Grade
     6     10-11    Fifth Grade
     7     11-12    Sixth Grade
     8     12-13    Seventh Grade
     9     13-14    Eighth Grade
    10     14-15    Ninth Grade
    11     15-16    Tenth Grade
    12     16-17    Eleventh grade
    13     17-18    Twelfth grade
    14     18-22    College
Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the following dictionary to look up the age range and grade level.

ari_scale = {
     1: {'ages':   '5-6', 'grade_level': 'Kindergarten'},
     2: {'ages':   '6-7', 'grade_level':    '1st Grade'},
     3: {'ages':   '7-8', 'grade_level':    '2nd Grade'},
     4: {'ages':   '8-9', 'grade_level':    '3rd Grade'},
     5: {'ages':  '9-10', 'grade_level':    '4th Grade'},
     6: {'ages': '10-11', 'grade_level':    '5th Grade'},
     7: {'ages': '11-12', 'grade_level':    '6th Grade'},
     8: {'ages': '12-13', 'grade_level':    '7th Grade'},
     9: {'ages': '13-14', 'grade_level':    '8th Grade'},
    10: {'ages': '14-15', 'grade_level':    '9th Grade'},
    11: {'ages': '15-16', 'grade_level':   '10th Grade'},
    12: {'ages': '16-17', 'grade_level':   '11th Grade'},
    13: {'ages': '17-18', 'grade_level':   '12th Grade'},
    14: {'ages': '18-22', 'grade_level':      'College'}
}
The output should look something like the following:
--------------------------------------------------------
The ARI for gettysburg-address.txt is 12
This corresponds to a 11th Grade level of difficulty
that is suitable for an average person 16-17 years old.

# Of course, time, and my growing up caused me to bring him into a

# his field of endeavor. When he died his friends mourned for fond
# remembrance of things past, but privately many of them felt that he had
# outlived his best days. Now with this glorious vindication, I wonder how
# many of them are still alive to feel the twinge of conscience....

# Oh, we're delighted of course, but it seems incredible even today to us
# elated oldsters. Although we were always his staunchest admirers, in
# retrospect we can see now that no one believed more than we that he did
# it strictly for the dollar. It is likely there was always a small corps
# of starry-eyed adolescents who found the whole improbable saga entirely
# believable, or at least half believed it might be partly true. The
# attitude of the rest of us ranged from a patronizing disparagement that
# we thought was expected of us, through grudging admiration, to
# out-and-out enthusiasm.

# Certainly if anybody had taken the trouble to consider it--and why
# should they have?--the landing of the first manned ship on our satellite
