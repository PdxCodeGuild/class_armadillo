MISS OTWAY OPENS THE STORY


I date the opening of this narrative, February 24, 1860.

I was in the drawing-room of my father's house on the afternoon of that
day, awaiting the arrival of Captain Burke, of the ship 'Lady Emma,'
and his wife, Mary Burke, who had nursed me and brought me up, and
indeed been as a mother to me after my own mother's death in 1854; but
she had left us to marry Captain Edward Burke, and had already made two
voyages round the world with him, and was presently going a third.

My father sat beside the fire reading a newspaper. His name was Sir
Mortimer Otway; he was fourth baronet and a colonel; had seen service
in India, though he had long left the army to settle down upon his
little seaside estate. He was a man of small fortune. Having said this,
I need not trouble you with more of his family history.

I was his only surviving child, and my name is Marie; I have no other
Christian name than that; it was my mother's. My age was twenty and my
health delicate, so much so that Captain and Mrs. Burke were coming
from London expressly to talk over a scheme of my going round the world
in their ship for the benefit of my appetite and spirits and voice, and
perhaps for my lungs, though to be sure _they_ were still sound at that
date.

Ours was a fine house, about a hundred years old; it stood within a
stone's throw of the brink of the cliff; walls and hedges encompassed
some seventy or eighty acres of land, pleasantly wooded in places, and
there was a charming scene of garden on either hand the carriage drive.
I stood at the window with my eyes fastened upon the sea, which went in
a slope of grey steel to the dark sky of the horizon, where here and
there some roaming mass of vapour was hoary with snow. It was blowing
a fresh breeze, and the throb of the ocean was cold with the ice-like
glances of the whipped foam. Presently it thickened overhead, and snow
fell in a squall of wind that darkened the early afternoon into evening
with smoking lines of flying flakes. The sea faded as the reflection
of a star in troubled water. My father put down his newspaper and came
to the window. He was a tall man, bald, high-coloured; his eyes were
large and black, soft in expression, and steady in gaze; his beard
and moustache were of an iron grey, he was sixty years old, yet still
preserved the soldier's trick of carrying his figure to the full height
of his stature.

'At what hour do you say they're to be here?'

'At three.'

He glanced at his watch, then out of the window.

'That doesn't look like a scene where a delicate girl's going to get
strong!'

'No,' I answered with a shiver.

'But a crown piece on a chart will often cover the area of worse
weather than this, and for leagues beyond all shall be glorious
sunshine and blue water.'

'It's hard to realise,' said I, straining my eyes through the snow for
a sight of the sea.

'Well,' he exclaimed, turning his back upon the window, 'Bradshaw is
an able man; his instances of people whom a sea voyage has cured are
remarkable, and weigh with me. Living by the seaside is not like going
a voyage. It's the hundred climates which make the medicine. Then the
sights and sounds of the ocean are tonical. Are sailors ever ill at
sea? Yes, because they carry their sickness on board with them, or they
decay by bad usage, or perish by poisonous cargoes. The sea kills no
man--save by drowning.'

He took a turn about the room, and I stared through the window at the
flying blankness.

'Steam is more certain,' he went on, thinking aloud. 'You can time
yourself by steam. But then for health it doesn't give you all you
want. At least we can't make it fit in your case. It would be otherwise
if I had the means or was able to accompany you, or if I could put
you in charge of some sober, trustworthy old hand. Steam must signify
several changes to give you the time at sea that Bradshaw prescribes.
It's out of the question. No; Mrs. Burke's scheme is the practicable
one, and I shall feel easy when I think of you as watched over by your
old nurse. But I have several questions to ask. When are they coming?
Have they missed their train?'

About five minutes after this they were shown in.

Mrs. Burke, my old nurse, was a homely, plain, soft-hearted woman, a
little less than forty years of age at this time. She was stout, and
pale, though she was now a traveller, with large, short-sighted blue
eyes, a flat face, and a number of chins. She was dressed as you would
wish a homely skipper's wife to be: in a neat bonnet with a heavy
Shetland veil wrapped around it; a stout mantle, and a gown of thick
warm stuff. She sank a little curtsey to my father, who eagerly stepped
forward and cordially greeted his old servant; in an instant I had my
arms round her neck. You will believe I loved her when I tell you she
had come to my mother's service when I was a month old, and had been
my nurse and maid, and looked after me as a second mother down to the
time when she left us to be married.

Her husband stood smiling behind her. He was short, an Irishman: he
looked the completest sailor you can imagine--that is, a merchant
sailor. He was richly coloured by the sun, and his small, sharp, merry,
liquid blue eyes gleamed and trembled and sparkled in their sockets
like a pair of stars in some reflected hectic of sunset in the eastern
sky. Everything about him told of heartiness and good humour: there
was something arch in the very curl of his little slip of whiskers. A
set of fine white teeth lighted up his face like a smile of kindness
whenever he parted his lips. He was dressed in the blue cloth coat
and velvet collar, the figured waist-coat and bell-shaped trousers,
of the merchant service in those days, and over all he wore a great
pilot-cloth coat, whose tails fell nearly to his heels; inside of
which, as inside a sentry box, he stood up on slightly curved, easily
yielding legs, a model of a clean, wholesome, hearty British skipper.

Of course I had met him before. I had attended his marriage, and was
never so dull but that the recollection of his face on that occasion
would make me smile, and often laugh aloud. He had also with his wife
spent a day with us after the return of his ship from the first voyage
they had made together. My father shook him cordially by the hand. He
then led him into the library, whilst I took Mrs. Burke upstairs.

We could have found a thousand things to say to each other; there were
memories of sixteen years of my life common to us both. I could have
told her of my engagement and shown her my sweetheart's picture; but I
was anxious to hear Captain Burke on the subject of my proposed voyage,
and so after ten minutes we went downstairs, where we found my father
and the captain seated before a glowing fire, already deep in talk.

The captain jumped up when I entered, my father placed a chair for Mrs.
Burke, who curtseyed her thanks, and the four of us sat.

'Well, now, Mrs. Burke,' said my father, addressing her very earnestly,
'your husband's ship is your suggestion, you know. You've sailed round
the world in her and you can tell me more about the sea than your
husband knows'--the captain gave a loud, nervous laugh--'as to the
suitability of such a ship and such a voyage as you recommend to Miss
Otway.'

'I am sure, Sir Mortimer,' answered Mrs. Burke, 'that it'll do her
all the good, and more than all the good, that the doctors promise.
I should love to have her with me.' She turned to look at me
affectionately. 'Since you can't accompany her, sir, I'd not like to
think of her at sea, and me without the power of caring for her. No
steamer could be safer than the "Lady Emma."' The captain uttered a
nervous laugh of good-humoured derision of steamers. 'If you will
trust my dear young lady to me, I'll warrant you, Sir Mortimer,
there's not the most splendid steamship afloat that shall make her a
comfortabler home than my husband's vessel.'
