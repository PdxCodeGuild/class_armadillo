Lab 18: Count Words =====================================================================

Let's write a python module to analyze a given text file containing a book for its 
vocabulary frequency and display the most frequent words to the user in the terminal. 
Remember there isn't any "perfect" way to identify a word in english (acronymns, mr/ms, 
contractions, etc), try to find rules that work best.

Find a book on Project Gutenberg. Download it as a UTF-8 text file.

"""


import requests


"""
1. Get the text from the file, via "with open..." or using requests
"""


"""
2.  Make everything lowercase, strip punctuation, split into a list of words.
"""


"""
3.  Your dictionary will have words as keys and counts as values. If a word isn't in your 
    dictionary yet, add it with a count of 1. If it is, increment its count.
"""


"""
4.  Print the most frequent top 10 out with their counts. You can do that with the code below.
