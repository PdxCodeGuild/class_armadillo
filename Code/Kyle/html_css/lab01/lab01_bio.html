        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor">John Jacob Astor</a></strong> (born <strong>Johann Jakob Astor</strong>; July 17, 1763 – March 29, 1848) was a German–American businessman, merchant, real estate mogul and investor who mainly made his fortune in a fur trade monopoly and by investing in real estate in or around New York City. A German immigrant entrepreneur envisioning the expansion of the fledging nation's population westward, Astor entered the fur trade and built a monopoly. Astor would ultimately manage a business empire that extended to the Great Lakes region and Canada, and later expanded into the American West and Pacific coast. Seeing a decline in demand due to changing European tastes, he got out of the fur trade in 1830, diversifying by investing in New York City real estate. Astor was highly wealthy and became a famed patron of the arts. He was the first prominent member of the Astor family and the first multi-millionaire in the United States.
