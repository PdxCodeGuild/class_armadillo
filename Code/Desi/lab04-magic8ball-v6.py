Let's write a program to simulate the classic "Magic Eight Ball"

Print a welcome screen to the user.
Prompt the user to ask the 8-ball a question.
For example: "Will I win the lottery tomorrow?"
Use the random module's random.choice() to choose a prediction.
Display the result of the prediction.

import random 

Possible_Random_qestions = ["without a doubt", "ask again later", "not likely"]

random.choice(possible_random_questions)
print(random.choice)


welcome_screen = ("Are you feeling lucking today?")
print(welcome_screen)

Input("Will I ever win the lottery")
Possible_Random_qestions = ["without a doubt", "ask again later", "not likely"]
random.choice(possible_random_questions)
